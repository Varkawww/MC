How to Upgrade Your SevTech Server:

1. MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR WORLD AND PRESTIGE FODLER THEN STORE IT ELSEWHERE. (Make sure it's safe from the Creepers)

2. Download the latest version from CurseForge.  
   **Note: the server files come out after the client is, and is published as quickly as possible, but there are delays in the approval process. If it's not listed, be patient.
   **Note: The server files on the ATLauncher ARE NOT the same as the provided ones on CurseForge.  They are just curated from the client itself.

3. Shut down your server.

4. In your server's directory, locate the following directories and delete them:
        - config
        - journeymap
        - mods
        - resources
        - scripts
        - structures

	DON'T DELETE THE WORLD OR PRESTIGE FOLDER
        
5. Copy the contents from the Zip file you downloaded to your server folder. Overwrite any files requested.

6. Run the Install script for your system to update Forge to the version needed.

7. Upload the entire libraries folder to the server also. As changes could of been made and you'll need them otherwise you'll have bad times.

8. Run your server. Profit!
